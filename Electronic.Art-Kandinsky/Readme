Kinetic Sculpture “Nr. 13 Spatial Study”

This project is a kinetic sculpture inspired by the works of Nicolas Schöffer, the pioneer of cybernetic art. The sculpture explores the interaction between movement, perception, and technology by integrating mechanical motion controlled by servomotors.
🎨 Concept

The sculpture follows Schöffer’s philosophy of merging art with cybernetic principles, creating an autonomous system that reacts dynamically to its environment. It challenges the traditional role of artistic authority and emphasizes trust in the creative process.
🛠️ Materials and Techniques

    Materials: metal structures, servomotors, Arduino microcontroller, wiring, power supply

    Techniques: kinetic assembly, motion programming, and structural design for dynamic stability

⚙️ Functionality

The motion is driven by servomotors controlled via an Arduino-based program, which defines movement patterns and behaviors. The code used for motor control is included in the project files.
✅ Conclusion

The project combines art and technology, echoing Schöffer’s vision of cybernetic art. The result is a sculpture that interacts with its surroundings through movement, embodying both artistic and mechanical expression.
